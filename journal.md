The new school cell phone law presents both opportunities and difficulties for students and teachers as they adjust to a less technology-dependent school environment.The law promotes increased focus during class and encourages more face-to-face social interaction during breaks and lunch. However, some students feel a loss of independence and are concerned about not being able to contact family quickly in case of an emergency. Many teachers find a calmer classroom environment with fewer distractions, leading to higher student engagement. On the other hand, some teachers face difficulties with enforcement and managing student resistance, which can add stress to their daily routines.The policy intends to create a more focused learning space, but its implementation requires both students and teachers to adapt their daily behaviors and classroom procedures.The evidence demonstrates the duality of the new cell phone law, showing how the goal of reducing distractions has led to both positive and negative experiences for the school community. The increased focus in class and improved social connections are a direct result of students no longer being constantly engaged with their devices. This shows that the law is succeeding in its core mission of limiting technology distractions. However, the difficulty with emergency communication and the feelings of lost independence among students are also a direct consequence of the same policy. The need for new procedures and the challenge of enforcing rules highlights the logistical and social friction that comes with such a major policy shift for teachers and students alike. Therefore, while the law is achieving its intended benefits, the transition is not without its complications, creating a mixed experience for those adjusting to the new rules.

A carrer im interested in is being a doctor because I think its a good job and saves people. Doctors use a machine called a sequencer, they can use it by taking saliva and placing it inside to get information and download a database of new virsus to see what you have. Almost all countries use a sequencer in they're healthcare systems, this will help doctors understand more and help faster. Computer science can also help doctors by improving they're patients diagnosis or even treatment. Computer science can also help doctors care through tools like electronic health records (EHRs), clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and medical imaging technology are all ways computer science can help doctors.

I think my Artificial Intelegence (AI) app can help schools be more advanced because Ai can be a lot more helpful than old ways of teaching or even helping. One way Artificial Intelegance can help schools is by giving students personalized education to help improve learning enviroments. Another way is improved administrative effiency this can help teachers improve in teaching and help admin manage school operations, budgets, hiring and supervising staff, communicating with parents and the public, and creating a positive learning enviroment for students and teachers. My app can also help with enhanced communication, so admin and teachers would be able to comtact parents or gaurdians incase of emergency. I think this is how my app can be a better Ai and maybe be the future to better schools.

I think a virtual job in roblox would be a good way for teens to earn money. IKEA could have 9 to 10 people working to stock shelves this can help a lot of people earn money. People working on the go, at home, or even on vacation can use the IKEA roblox game to pay for groceries, clothes, and shoes. employees who work can get promoted to higher departments which can be helpful to people who work hard. This can either be really good or really bad it depends on how people treat this new virtual job. I difinitely would work at IKEA on roblox to earn extra cash.

The phrase 6-7 often said during class is a meme that was created on tiktok, youtube, and instagram. The person who first said it was a basketball player on a AAU team for Rod Wave Elite. One day they were at a basketball game and they filmed the crowd. One kid stood out and said 6-7. Later people made memes of it. He then became a meme.

If i was in charge of my own school i would probably ban Ai and not allow cell phones, I would still allow games to be played on the chromebooks. I would ban Ai like chatGPT, Gauth Ai, Question Ai, and SolveX.Ai because this can ruin kids learning skills and wont help them learn anything. I would ban Phones and only let students use them incase of emergency for they're safety. I would not ban Games because when students are finished with there work they can keep themselves busy buy playing Cool Math Gmaes, Totally Science, and much more. I would let students use they're phones at lunch becuase who likes eating without their phone. I would hope my students like these policies for my school and like me if I was in charge.

## Reflection
After making my own math educational game my prompt was designed to help students with there math and ultimitaly help them in general making their brains stronger. The canva design interpreted an math like deisgn while still keeping it not like a elementrary game. Honestly all of the interacted parts work best the begining, middle, and the end. In the begining it asks for your name, how you feel about math, and what are your biggest goals are for math. During the math games if you get one right the computer cheers for you, but if you get one wrong it tells its not right but to keep trying and soon you'll get it right. At the end the of the quiz you can either take it again with different problems or take another topic the student is the one that chosses there path. Ultimately I designed this game to help high schoolers improve their learning skills for later in the future or even now.

The new school cell phone law presents both opportunities and difficulties for students and teachers as they adjust to a less technology-dependent school environment.The law promotes increased focus during class and encourages more face-to-face social interaction during breaks and lunch. However, some students feel a loss of independence and are concerned about not being able to contact family quickly in case of an emergency. Many teachers find a calmer classroom environment with fewer distractions, leading to higher student engagement. On the other hand, some teachers face difficulties with enforcement and managing student resistance, which can add stress to their daily routines.The policy intends to create a more focused learning space, but its implementation requires both students and teachers to adapt their daily behaviors and classroom procedures.The evidence demonstrates the duality of the new cell phone law, showing how the goal of reducing distractions has led to both positive and negative experiences for the school community. The increased focus in class and improved social connections are a direct result of students no longer being constantly engaged with their devices. This shows that the law is succeeding in its core mission of limiting technology distractions. However, the difficulty with emergency communication and the feelings of lost independence among students are also a direct consequence of the same policy. The need for new procedures and the challenge of enforcing rules highlights the logistical and social friction that comes with such a major policy shift for teachers and students alike. Therefore, while the law is achieving its intended benefits, the transition is not without its complications, creating a mixed experience for those adjusting to the new rules.

A carrer im interested in is being a doctor because I think its a good job and saves people. Doctors use a machine called a sequencer, they can use it by taking saliva and placing it inside to get information and download a database of new virsus to see what you have. Almost all countries use a sequencer in they're healthcare systems, this will help doctors understand more and help faster. Computer science can also help doctors by improving they're patients diagnosis or even treatment. Computer science can also help doctors care through tools like electronic health records (EHRs), clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and medical imaging technology are all ways computer science can help doctors.
